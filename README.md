# My First Program (January 12th 2016)
My first own WORKING program, written in JavaScript on January 12th 2016... 

I found evidence that I might even have wrote this in 2015

an older version from 2015 *which does not work* is saved as something_funny.js (https://github.com/TheFel0x/My-First-Program-from-2015-2016/blob/master/something_funny.js) 

So I can assume that I first got into programming late 2015

8th, last, and working version of the program... 

since then I wrote a version of this in every programming language I learned... 

I wrote this in the Google Chrome Browser inside the console. (F12)
